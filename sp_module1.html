  <div class="chapter">
    <h2>Chapter 1 — Introduction to Upstream Flow</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to the first module of the Super Premium program. Today marks your journey into living upstream — the art of aligning your consciousness, body, and energy in a way that allows life to flow harmoniously, with minimal friction and maximal clarity.
      Living upstream is a mindset and a practice. It’s the recognition that most of human suffering originates not in the world, but in the misalignment of thought, energy, and action. As you progress through this module, consider that the ability to navigate life with flow is not a skill you acquire in hours—it is a deep, gradual awakening that requires observation, practice, and reflection.
    </p>
    <div class="exercise">
      <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Sit in silence for 10 minutes. Observe the thoughts that arise, the physical sensations, and any emotional responses. Do not try to change anything—simply notice. Write down your observations in a journal.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Chapter 2 -->
  <div class="chapter">
    <h2>Chapter 2 — Observing Consciousness</h2>
    <p>
      Consciousness is the field in which your entire life unfolds. Most people navigate their days unaware of the filters that distort their perception. In this chapter, we explore how to notice these filters. Start by recognizing recurring patterns: mental chatter, judgment, and reactive emotional loops. 
      Observing without interference is the first act of upstream living. As you practice, you will begin to notice that thoughts are not commands; emotions are signals, not facts. This distinction gives you space to choose your response rather than react unconsciously.
    </p>
    <div class="exercise">
      <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Spend 10 minutes documenting recurring mental loops and emotional triggers. Notice the sensations in your body that accompany them. Reflect: Which patterns serve me? Which patterns restrict me?</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Chapter 3 -->
  <div class="chapter">
    <h2>Chapter 3 — Mental Atmosphere & Energy Loops</h2>
    <p>
      Your mental atmosphere is the invisible environment in which your life unfolds. It is shaped by thought patterns, beliefs, and emotional tendencies. Energy loops form when the mind and body resonate with recurring stimuli, creating cycles of tension or ease. 
      Understanding these loops is crucial: once identified, they can be adjusted. The upstream mindset encourages subtle interventions—breath, focus, attention—to gently reconfigure energy patterns, allowing a freer flow of consciousness.
    </p>
    <div class="exercise">
      <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Map your mental energy today. Identify 3 situations where tension peaks. Observe without judgment, then consciously adjust posture and breath. Document changes in perception or emotional tone.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Chapter 4 -->
  <div class="chapter">
    <h2>Chapter 4 — Physical Body as Vehicle</h2>
    <p>
      The body is the vessel of consciousness. Misalignment between mind and body creates friction, tension, and reactive energy. By consciously integrating posture, breath, and subtle movements, you align your physical vehicle with your inner awareness. 
      Begin with micro-adjustments: shoulders relaxed, spine upright, breath deep and smooth. Observe how these physical shifts ripple into clarity of thought and emotional stability.
    </p>
    <div class="exercise">
      <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Perform a 10-minute body scan. Move from head to toe, observing tension points. With each exhalation, gently release tightness. Journal the subtle changes in thought, mood, and perception.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Chapter 5 -->
  <div class="chapter">
    <h2>Chapter 5 — Integration & Journaling</h2>
    <p>
      Integration is where observation, breath, posture, and awareness converge. Reflection solidifies upstream practice, creating the bridge between insight and habit. Use journaling to externalize the internal landscape, noticing patterns, insights, and opportunities for growth.
    </p>
    <div class="exercise">
      <p><strong>Journaling Prompts:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>What recurring mental patterns did I observe today?</li>
        <li>Which physical tensions shifted during alignment exercises?</li>
        <li>How did conscious awareness influence my interactions with others?</li>
        <li>Which upstream insights can I carry forward tomorrow?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Imagine a professional constantly under pressure in a corporate environment. Before upstream practice, every task felt heavy, energy drained, and interactions tense. By applying the principles of body alignment, mental observation, and awareness of energy loops, tension decreased, decision-making sharpened, and team harmony improved. Even a small daily upstream routine rippled through all areas of life, illustrating the profound potential of conscious alignment.
